# iOS Safari PWA View Height Bug
I found a bug in iOS's standalone PWA browser regarding how view height is calculated. I had this hosted at one point but I don't anymore. If you want to test it, you'll have to host it yourself somewhere. Testing locally may be difficult (or impossible) because you can't install a PWA without a valid certificate.
